• Designed a class which functions as an abstraction for games such as Hangman, WordSearch, NumberGuesser, and RPS.
• Created Hangman, WordSearch, NumberGuesser, and RPS game classes that extend from game class.
• Utilized DFS and BS algorithms to produce ways to achieve optimal solutions for Hangman and NumberGuesser.
• Enhanced user experience by utilizing Java’s framework to have a playing user interface for GameGrabber’s games.
